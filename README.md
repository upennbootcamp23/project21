## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. While I had some help from my friend deannapi, I used the files FOR INSPIRATION ONLY. I can safely guarantee you that this project is MY OWN, ORIGINAL WORK.

The link to the help is https:[//github.com/stellalph/19-PWA-Text-Editor/tree/main/client/dist](https://github.com/deannapi/book-search-engine)

2. The project contained starter code presented by UPenn Bootcamp. The link to its repository is [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/cautious-meme](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli).

3. I had trouble with Render - in deploying the project. Luckily, Professor Maddatu helped me fix those issues. So thanks, Professor!
